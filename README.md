# UMA-Text
A repo for the Kantara Initiative UMA text.  https://kantarainitiative.org/groups/user-managed-access-work-group/

In collaboration with the UMA-WG and particularly with work by @xmmgrrl. But unofficial, unless and until forked by Kantara.   Note that we originally did this work with the thought that it would be a separate repo, and have retained the links to "GH/KantaraInitiative/UMA-Text."  That <i>anticipates</i> it being forked to KantaraInitiative, but it has not.  So we repeat, only official when actually hosted at github.com/KantaraInitiative/, and subject to whatever notices or comments they may make.

UMA is a robust system of User Managed Access - a secure system for persons (people and organizations) to respectfully treat information about other persons.
