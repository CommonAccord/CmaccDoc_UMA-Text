# UMA-Text
A repo for the Kantara Initiative UMA text.  https://kantarainitiative.org/groups/user-managed-access-work-group/

In collaboration with the UMA-WG and particularly with work by @xmmgrrl. But unofficial, unless and until forked by Kantara.  

UMA is a robust system of User Managed Access - a secure system for one person to respectfully treat information about other persons.

These materials are presented at http://www.commonaccord.org/index.php?action=list&file=/GH/KantaraInitiative/UMA-Text/.

For general information about handling legal text as "prose objects," see https://github.com/CommonAccord/Form-Agt/edit/master/README.md.
